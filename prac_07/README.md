# Practical 07

## Overview
Welcome to my CP1404 practicals repository! This repo contains my solutions for the practical exercises in the
CP1404 subject. Throughout this course, I've focused improving my programming skills.

## About Me
I'm a student working through the CP1404 subject, and these practicals have helped me refine my understanding of programming patterns, problem-solving, and code organization.

## Lessons Learned in Clean Code
- **Meaningful Naming**: I've learned to use descriptive and clear names for variables and functions.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling
- **Avoiding Magic Numbers**: Replacing hard-coded values (magic numbers) with named constants
